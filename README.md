# Hangman

Specification

1. Create a webpage in HTML that resembles the hangman game with a title, some information about the game, alphabet tiles as buttons, number of lives, a square for the hangman to go in, and an end game screen.

2. Style the html.

3. Create the javascript play functionality.
   3a. Need to check if the letter is in the word and do certain things if it is or isn't.
   3b. Need to make sure lives goes down if incorrect and the letter appears in the word if correct.
   3c. Need to black out the letters that have already been chosen.
   3d. Need to be able to clear the game and start again after the game as been won, and add a new word.
   3e. The guess tiles need to be the same as the amount of characters in the word so they can't be declared in index.html as they will change dynamically, so you need to create them in javascript.

4. Create the hangman animation.

5. Create an API that pulls random words to be used in the game.
